D,[t] troubleshooting ad-500 and ad-600 no picture scrolling b/w" 
D,i/p button[+],"im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! 
D,dvd player[+],"but  if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player  i love it ! 
D,dvd player[+][p],"it practically plays almost everything you give it" 
D,player[+]sound[-],"i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor" 
D,price[+],"for the price it is a well spent investment ! 
D,dvd player[+][p],"this is by far the nicest one  in so many ways" 
D,look[+]panel button layout[+]feature[+],"it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout  and it has a great feature set" 
D,forward[+] rewind[+],"its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had" 
D,video format[+],"it plays alternate video formats ( vcds  svcds  cvds ) very well" 
D,price[+],"and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? 
D,play[+] dvd-r[+],"what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e.  mp3s )" 
D,dvd-r[+][p],"it sure does ! 
D,dvd-r[+][p],"that 's a rare and valuable feature" 
D,audio output[+],"another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs  though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying" 
D,forward[+],"at double-speed ( 2x forward speed )  it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth  but twice as fast ! 
D,remote control[-] mp3 filename[-],"weaknesses are minor , the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x  3x  4x  1/2x  etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ]" 
D,finish[+],"update , the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! 
D,play[-] disney movie[-],"many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player" 
D,dual-layer dvd[-],"player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2" 
D,player[+] look[+],"player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play" 
D,player[-],"i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse" 
D,apex[-],"will never purchase apex again" 
D,customer service[-] technical support[-],"customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them" 
D,case[+],"for the first few weeks  this player was everything i expected it to be  an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised" 
D,dvd[-] read[-] play[-],"then my dvds would stop playing in the middle  or not even be read at all" 
D,cd[-],"new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays" 
D,player[-],"i thought it was just the player  but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media" 
D,player[-],"this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it" 
D,support[-][u],"apex does n't answer the phone" 
D,customer service[-],"no way to contact their customer service" 
D,quality[-],"very bad quality" 
D,player[+],"i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites" 
D,player[+],"i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him" 
D,player[+][p],"have used it frequently and have had no problems" 
D,player[+][p],"i liked this one enough to buy another" 
D,apex[+],"my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money" 
D,picture quality[+]feature[+],"great quality picture and features" 
D,[t] 2 out of three ai n't good" 
D,player[-][p],"they play just about everything  but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them" 
D,player[-],"nice machines  but i consider their quality pretty low now" 
D,player[-][u],"this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas" 
D,door[-],"the door would not close" 
D,customer service[-],"i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept" 
D,look[+] feature[+],"it looks great - and is loaded with features" 
D,player[-][p],"unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type" 
D,player[-][u],"have had problems since the first day 
D,play[-] dvd[-],"- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days  it just would not recognize anything i pop in it" 
D,apex[+],"the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me" 
D,player[+][p],"i bought mine in december of 2003  and have had no real problems with it" 
D,heat[-][u],"it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation" 
D,smell[-],"it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time" 
D,freezing[-],"the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing  which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air" " 
D,player[+],"( he had owned two apex dvd players  and was pleased with both of them" ) 
D,jpeg slideshow[+]mpeg1[+],"the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist  and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting" 
D,remote[-],"the remote is okay  but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons" 
D,button[-],"i especially like the more commonly used buttons  such as play  pause  and stop  to be larger and conveniently placed" 
D,zoom mode[-],"i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode" 
D,zoom[-],"the zoom goes up and down in magnification  which is nice  but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings" 
D,onscreen display[-],"having spent considerable time with professional video gear  i find onscreen displays annoying" 
D,player[+][p],"while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4  i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it" 
D,picture[-] player[-][p],"it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do" 
D,player[-],"i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's  after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job" 
D,customer service[-],"i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked" 
D,play[-] disc[-],"wo n't play a lot of discs" 
D,play[-],"some movies it played yesterday  it wo n't play today" 
D,play[-],"it wo n't play 80 % of my movies  which are all store boughten" 
D,tech support[-],"tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent" 
D,player[-][u],"i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 
D,dvd player[-],"it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working" 
D,dvd player[-],"the dvd player does not work properly" 
D,player[-],"the player usually plays dvd 's  but has occasional problems such as , 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd" 
D,player[-][p],"this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something  it will work when it did not work one time before" 
D,customer support[-],"after we discovered the problems  we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months )  but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy  and they do not answer their web customer support" 
D,[t] ok if you have a 2nd dvd player" 
D,player[+][p],"nothing has broken on it  and it plays all the dvds i have" 
D,play[-] dvd[-],"unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd" 
D,dvd[-],"on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd" 
D,player[-],"unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds  and now the player can 't play everything" 
D,work[+],"we tried it out christmas night and it worked great" 
D,jpeg[+],"even viewed cds full of jpgs" 
D,picture[-] player[-][p],"but when we went to use it again  there was sound but no picture" 
D,apex[-],"i hate apex but love amazon  and i tell everyone" 
D,player[-][p],"who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out  but it probably will" 
D,remote[-],"we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked" 
D,dvd[-] play[-],"( on here of course ) also  a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones ! 
D,remote[-],"i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective" 
D,customer service[-],"the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line" 
D,apex[-],"i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again" 
D,door[-],"door broke after a month" 
D,unit[-],"unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs" 
D,player[-][p],"3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything" 
D,player[+],"well  it was nice while it lasted" 
D,player[-],"after @ 3 months  it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds" 
D,player[-][u],"as an engineer  i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale" 
D,player[-][p],"only used for 3 month before it 's down ! 
D,picture[-],"it sends discoutinous signals to tv  so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment" 
D,color[-],"the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated" 
D,unit[-][u],"the entire unit was poorly crafted" 
D,screw tip[-],"there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board" 
D,dvd[-] play[-],"after hooking the thing up  i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it" 
D,player[-],"the dvd player just would't recognize them" 
D,no disc[-],"it would spin  read  spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc" 
D,[t] apex ad2600" 
D,format[+][u]progressive scan[+],"this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos  jpeg  wma  cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw  and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff  progressive scan feature" 
D,player[-],"i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed ! 
D,customer service[-],"they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy" 
D,feature[+],"because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision  non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's" 
D,play[+] different file[+],"the cool thing about the ad-600 it plays alot of different file like mp3  wma cds  jpeg and kodak picture cds  dvd 's  dvd - / + r 's" 
D,play[+] mpeg[+],"it 's not a listed feature but  the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video" 
D,mpeg[+][p],"i find this to be a great feature" 
D,play[+][p],"i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great" 
D,feature[+],"for the money apex machines have good features" 
D,design[+],"it 's low profile  space saving design looks nice" 
D,player[+][u],"i find the apex ad-600 to be a great buy" 
D,player[-][p],"now i know why - they are pieces of junk" 
D,no disc[-] screen[-][u],"less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc" " 
D,service[-],"same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing" 
D,format[+],"i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd  but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper" 
D,aff[+],"the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal" 
D,design[+],"loved the slim design" 
D,[t] black and white only after 1 month of use" 
D,color signal[-],"this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared" 
D,customer service[-],"apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy" 
D,[t] most bang for the buck. i recieved my 2600 4 days ago and feel that this may be the best $ 50 i have ever spent" 
D,audio[+],"audio is excellent" 
D,player[+] format[+],"i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer" 
D,player[+][p],"but  it seems to work so well now  that i do n't anticipate any problems with it" 
D,player[+][u],"simple to use and hook up" 
D,progressive scan[+]remote[+],"the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used" 
D,player[-],"this dvd play is basicly junk" 
D,play[-][p],"it wo n't play all of my movies" 
D,customer service[-],"i tried called apex cust service  no help" 
D,player[-][p],"mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash  where it belongs" 
D,player[-][p],"each of the 4 lasted less than six months" 
D,player[+],"this is the best dvd player i 've purchased"

D,[t] apex ad2600 known capadabilty problem" 
D,play[-] dvd[-] no disc[-],"i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message )" 
D,dvd player[+],"well  this apex dvd player turned out great ! 
D,media[+][u],"it plays basically every media i 've tested so far  even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! 
D,user interface[+],"i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg  mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds" 
D,player[+],"i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player" 
D,look[+][u]panel[+],"and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! 
D,remote control[-],"one bad thing though  i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does" 
D,shipping[+],"finally  amazon 's free shipping is really getting good  it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! 
D,player[-],"i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts  and both were bad" 
D,player[-],"the first one would n't work from the start" 
D,player[-],"the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! 
D,on-line support[-][u],"i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line  but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy" 
D,player[+],"for the most part this is a good dvd player" 
D,dvd[-] picture[-] play[-],"but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem  when watching a movie the picture will freeze  but the dvd still plays  and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments" 
D,product[-][u],"we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working" 
D,picture[-] sound[-],"there was neither picture nor sound" 
D,product[+],"we are overall pleased with product" 
D,manual[-],"i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual" 
D,picture[-],"it worked from 12-6 to 1- at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to" ) 
D,support[-],"i tried calling the support number for a week  several times a day  and always got a busy signal" 
D,support[-],"neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days" ) 
D,dvd[-] read[-] no disc[-],"it only read the dvds 10 % of the time  otherwise i would get a no disc screen" 
D,progressive scan player[+]price[+],"progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba  pioneer  and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well )" 
D,dvd[+]sound[+],"seems to read most dvds fine  and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise )" 
D,read[+] svcd[+] vbr mp3 cd[+],"also  i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-200 had trouble with these )" 
D,output[+],"output through component connections looks very good  on my non-hd tv" 
D,disc[-] recognize[-],"i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs  but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 )" 
D,no disc[-],"it would just spin up and stop  and display " no disc "" 
D,remote[-],"my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote  which is worse than other  cheaper apex units" 
D,button[-],"you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll" 
D,s-video[-],"also  for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video  with lots of color bleeding  compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ). 
D,player[+][p],"i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked  works  fine right out of the box" 
D,auto fit[+],"i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal" 
D,look[+][u],"looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors" 
D,remote[-],"and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last  but for 50 bucks what the heck ! 
D,play[+][p],"this thing plays everything i feed it" 
D,format[+][u],"when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with" 
D,use[+] size[+]look[+],"easy to use  small form factor  and looks good to boot" 
D,player[-][p],"after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty" 
D,no disc[-],"i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc" 
D,customer service[-][u],"i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable" 
D,customer service[-][u],"i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered" 
D,player[-][p],"it has never worked" 
D,player[-],"i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs  using a multitude of connection methods  and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine" 
D,player[-][u],"purchased the ad-600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it" 
D,on/off button[-],"the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button" 
D,customer service[-][u],"they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply" 
D,customer service[-],"i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response" 
D,player[-],"3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze" 
D,player[-],"now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk" 
D,customer service[-][u],"have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com )  but the e-mail address is not valid" 
D,customer service[-][u],"have tried calling ( 866-apexgo )  but can 't get through" 
D,player[-][u]customer service[-],"this product sucks  the customer service from apex sucks" 
D,play[-],"after using it for just a month  i could not play any dvd" 
D,picture[-],"i can only hear the sound but no picture !

D,player[-],"when the player was working it was great but" 
D,smell[+],"it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive" 
D,look[+],"without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen" 
D,picture quality[+],"excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer  panasonic  and jvc players" 
D,remote[+],"remote , you can stand it on end ( harder to lose )  and it 's far better designed than the 1100s" 
D,dvd[-],"first of all  i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed" 
D,player[+],"unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon "  my dvd player came in perfect working condition" 
D,design[+]player[+],"as a whole  the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine" 
D,dvd[-],"what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds" 
D,read[-],"for example  i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd  but this dvd player can not read it" 
D,read[-] dvd[-],"at first i thought it is only a isolated incident  but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well" 
D,player[+],"this player seems to work fine with everything else" 
D,player[-][u],"because of this  i am disappointed and would not recommend this product" 
D,run[+] dvd[+],"it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented" 
D,run[+] dvd media[+]#apex ad-600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw )" 
D,dvd player[+],"i think  apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price" 
D,apex[+],"most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy" 
D,player[+][p],"this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve" 
D,sound[+]picture clarity[+],"i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds  the picture clarity is unmatched ! 
D,case[+]price[+][u],"so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! 
D,picture[-][u],"after two weeks the picture kept freezing" 
D,apex[-],"apex sucks ! 
D,[t] video failed after 3 weeks" 
D,player[-][u],"unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed" 
D,size[+]machine[+],"it 's a compact  attractive machine and was easy to set up" 
D,usage[+],"basic usage is easy  but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used" 
D,player[+][p],"so far  we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine" 
D,picture[+]sound[+],"the picture is clear  bright and sharp and the sound is good" 
D,read[-] disc[-],"the catch is that  while it plays movies just fine  it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that" 
D,player[+][p],"it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it  and it 's possible that i 'm missing something" 
D,player[+],"i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation" 
D,player[+][p],"there are a lot of things i like about it" 
D,[t] apex ad-600 working so far" 
D,picture[+],"received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector" 
D,remote[-],"the remote is a little hard to understand" 
D,jpeg picture[-],"my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor"

D,video output[-],"video output stopped workin"

D,lip-sync[-],"there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue )" 
D,video[-],"but after 10 days  the sound worked  but the video quit working" 
D,amazon[+],"amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping" 
D,feature[+]reliability[-],"great feature list  poor reliability" 
D,output[-],"output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections  and with no v-hold" 
D,display[+],"retraction , said mine had silver plate , it does have display" 
D,player[+][p],"it works great" 
D,unit[+] format[+],"the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg  kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good  but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " ! 
D,remote[-],"p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? 
D,[t] does n't play my alias season 1 dvds" 
D,player[-][u],"what the hell is wrong with this thing" 
D,play[-] dvd[-],"forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds. 
D,video output[-],"well  within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic )" 
D,video output[-[p][u],"so now it still plays everything  you just can 't see it !

D,dvd[+],"and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play"

D,player[+][p],"i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of" 
D,player[+][p],"but for what i do use it is perfect" 
D,freeze[-] player[-],"1 ) frame freezes and the family yells  " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! " 
D,remote[-],"2 ) the remote works  but then it does not work  and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong" 
D,universal remote control[-],"5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control" 
D,code[-],"finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600" 
D,player[-],"one still works fine  the other quit after one day" 
D,manual[+],"owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide" 
D,customer service[-][u],"apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone" 
D,player[+],"the dvd player is fine" 
D,player[+][p],"of course  i was hesitant given the price  but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it  and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents" 
D,picture[+],"the picture is perfect  although i 'm not watching on an hdtv" 
D,loading[-][u],"it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait" 
D,player[+],"but  dollar for dollar  this dvd player is probably the best out there" 
D,picture[-],"when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine  but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! 
D,dvd[-]cd[-] no disc[-],"seemed like a good deal  but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes  " no disc "" 
D,dvd player[-],"granted  i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas  but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player" 
D,menu[-],"first  the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds" 
D,menu[-][p],"this is extemely lame" 
D,remote[-],"the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use" 
D,remote[-],"in addition  it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player  although that may have been just the batteries that came with it" 
D,dvd[+],"the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough" 
D,player[-][u],"after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment  for myself and for my parents  for whom it was a gift" 
D,dvd[-],"it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems  the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches" 
D,dvd[-],"both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback  while the counter on the player kept going" 
D,speed[-],"one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu" 
D,door[-],"the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed" 
D,size[+]remote layout[+],"there were a few attractive features  such as the small size and the layout of the remote" 
D,player[-],"all in all  trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift" 
D,player[-],"i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours  and then it died" 
D,player[+],"i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category" 
D,player[+][p],"i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine" 
D,noise[-] external display[-],"there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically )  and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance" 
D,look[+]feature[+],"still  i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! 
D,freeze[-],"i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! 
D,player[-][p],"i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !

D,[t] more trouble than it 's worth times 10" 
D,dvd[-] read[-],"unfortunately  the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way" 
D,support[-],"i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing" 
D,dvd player[+],"this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it" 
D,format[+],"ability to play most discs - i tried dvd  vcd  dvd-r  audio cd and it played all 
D,look[+],"good looks 
D,quality[-],"the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate  something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 
D,remote button[-],"remote buttons are small and closely spaced  especially with the menu buttons" 
D,player[+],"this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player" 
D,player[+],"i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !

A,canon powershot g3[+],"i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase" 
A,use[+],"the camera is very easy to use  in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group" 
A,picture[+],"they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely" ( as all of my pictures have thusfar )" 
A,picture quality[+],"a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality" 
A,picture quality[+],"i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine )" 
A,camera[+] use[+] feature[+],"bottom line  well made camera  easy to use  very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices" 
A,picture quality[+] use[+] option[+],"i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like" 
A,camera[+],"this is my first digital camera  and what a ' toy ' it is ! 
A,picture[+],"just a little overview  powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera  its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance" 
A,use[+],"whether you are a novice or an expert  its ease of use and functionality goes together" 
A,dial[-],", main dial is not backlit" 
A,viewfinder[-],", lens visible in optical viewfinder" 
A,camera[+][p],"overall i 'm happy with my toy" 
A,[t]canon g3 ? incredible camera 
A,camera[+],"in a word  " awesome " is how i would describe this camera" 
A,speed[+]picture quality[+]function[+],"i wo n't go into the details here  as the online sites ( stevesdigicams  dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews  but i am very pleased with the features  the speed  the picture quality  the flexibility  the automation  and the functional conveniences this camera offers" 
A,auto setting[+],"with the automatic settings  i really have n't taken a bad picture yet" 
A,camera[+],"i am absolutely in awe of this camera  canon put enormous quality into the g3" 
A,canon g3[+],"i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied" 
A,photo quality[+],"i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality" 
A,feature[+],"the g3 is loaded with many useful features  and unlike many smaller digital cameras  it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds" 
A,viewfinder[-],"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle  but since i use the lcd most of the time  this is not really much of a bother to me" 
A,camera[+],"despite this minor disappointment  i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography" 
A,camera[+],"i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful" 
A,photo quality[+],"the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features" 
A,darn diopter adjustment dial[-],"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is  it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight" ) 
A,exposure control[+]auto setting[+],"1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative  yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings" 
A,metering option[+],"excellent range of metering options as well" 
A,spot metering[+],"it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen" 
A,4mp[+],"2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 
A,zoom[+],"3 ) 4x zoom is nice 
A,focus[+],"5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible" 
A,focus[+],"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button  and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus" 
A,size[-][u]weight[-][u],"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s- aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery  although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
A,design[-][u],"2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
A,viewfinder[-],"4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying" 
A,feature[+] ,"the camera has a wonderful set of features" 
A,lcd[+],"the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures" 
A,optical zoom[+]digital zoom[+],"the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry" 
A,picture[+],"the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect" 
A,picture[+],"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing  etc ) so i am very pleased" 
A,software[+],"the canon computer software used to download  sort  upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use" 
A,lens cap[-]viewfinder[-],"the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd )" 
A,menu[+]button[+],"the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use" 
A,camera[+],"it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price" 
A,camera[+],"recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available" 
A,control[+],"advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable" 
A,auto setting[+],"newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box" 
A,photo quality[+],"4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome" 
A,use[+][u],"those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use" 
A,zoom[+]lense[+],"the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class" 
A,camera[+],"i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
A,picture[+] control[+] battery[+] software[+],"it gives great pictures  the controls are easy to use  the battery lasts forever on one single charge  the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing" 
A,photo quality[+] auto mode[+],"i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode" 
A,canera[+],"this camera has canon 's great colorimetry  plus what you see in the lcd is what you get" 
A,print[+],"the prints are beautiful ! 
A,battery[+],"although canon 's batteries are proprietary  they last a really long time  recharge fairly quickly in the camera  plus if you want ' more power '  you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon" 
A,[t]if you love an slr 35mm but need to go digital 
A,camera[+],"this is a great camera for you ! 
A,control[+]auto mode[+],"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use" 
A,control[+],"i love having the option to manually control the f-stop  shutter speed and even focus" 
A,photo[+],"i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works  and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers" 
A,control[+],"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera  the controls are very intuitive ! 
A,dial[+],"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects )  aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality" 
A,manual mode[+],"the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options" 
A,feel[+]weight[+],"this camera also has a great feel and weight to it" 
A,feel[+],"you feel like you are holding something of substance  not some cheap plastic toy" 
A,camera[+][p],"the more i work with it  the more i love it ! 
A,camera[+][u],"i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 
A,camera[+],"this is my first digital camera  and i am very pleased with it" 
A,camera[+][u],"seriously  this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want" 
A,picture[+] auto mode[+],"but at the same time  it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode  so that even an average joe like me can use it ! 
A,four megapixel[+],"four megapixels is great" 
A,product[+][u],"it is a very amazing product" 
A,camera[+][p],"i highly recommend it" 
A,[t]love my new g 3 
A,feature[+],"just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has" 
A,photo[+],"takes excellent photos" 
A,night mode[+],"night mode is clear as day" 
A,use[+][u],"i have not played with all the features yet  but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it" 
A,viewfinder[-],"the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens" 
A,camera[+],"overall it is the best camera on the market" 
A,picture quality[+],"a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great  it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time , - ) ) 
A,lens cover[-],"b ) the lens cover is surely loose  i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times  and au lens tigt and cause potential damage" 
A,zooming lever[-],"the zooming lever is shaky  i hope it does not operate mechanically  otherwise you 'll feel uneasy" 
A,camera[+],"i love this camera" 
A,picture[+],"took hundreds of pictures and they were great" 
A,color[+]picture[+]white balance[+],"great colors  pictures and white balance" 
A,optical zoom[+],"has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range" 
A,picture[-][u],"maybe it is my lack of experience  but i found shots with this camera very disappointing" 
A,price[-][u],"it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got" 
A,camera[-][u],"sure it had all the features  but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task" 
A,camera[-],"i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust" 
A,grain[-],"the grain was terrible" 
A,flash photo[-]noise[-],"well flash photos are never great  and there was still a lot of noise" 
A,photo[+],"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving  the photos were awesome" 
A,camera[+],"the camera was a marvel" 
A,camera[+][p],"it is versatile and seems to be one of the best" 
A,g3[+],"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality  clean images" 
A,lag time[-]flash[-],"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light )  and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash" 
A,depth[+],"what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8" 
A,flash[-],"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr  the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh  flat images with ugly hot spots" 
A,external flash hot shoe[+],"fortunately  the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash  and fortunately for me  i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy , the metz 60 ct-" 
A,flash[+],"contrary to what ive read elsewhere  the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes  just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon" 
A,software[-],"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf  which gives me 130 raw images  as opposed to 7 ! 
A,software[-],"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all  but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera" 
A,g3[+],"what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware" 
A,color[+],"without any tweaking at all  if the exposure is accurate  the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film  and this is a raw image ! 
A,g3[+]software[-],"the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software" 
A,software[-],"what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical" 
A,image[+],"but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera" 
A,raw image[+],"i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system )  and can easily put up with the cameras limitations  because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits" 
A,camera[+][p],"i 've had this for 3 months now  and i am pleased with my decision" 
A,camera[+],"this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well" 
A,battery life[+],"battery life  the drawback to most digital cameras  to quote k. reeves" 
A,manual function[+]picture quality[+],"manual functionality is excellent  downloading pictures is quick and a breeze  and the quality is astounding" 
A,viewfinder[-]lcd[+]camera[+],"not perfect ( yes  the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances )  not the cheapest 4.0 mp  but the best 4.0 mp" 
A,service[+],"the service from the supplier was exceptional" 
A,photo[+],"having used it for more than a month  i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos" 
A,photo[+],"by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot  i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced" 
A,automode[+]manual mode[+],"the camera is a dream to operate in automode  but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority  shutter priority  and manual modes" 
A,viewfinder[-],"about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder" 
A,camera[+],"i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! 
A,canon[+],"but canon never fails to amaze" 
A,raw format[+],"1" the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility" 
A,battery life[+],"2" battery life is over 4.5 hours  compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons" 
A,software[+],"3" the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing" 
A,shape[+],"4" the shape of this device is a little squarer  without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking" 
A,light auto correction[+],"the light auto-correction is awesome" 
A,picture[+],"you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right" 
A,white offset[+],"8" perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out )  the g3 has much sharper white offsets" 
A,g3[+],"overall  the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams  from a detail  tonal balance and color response point of view" 
A,camera[+][p],"this is quite simply the best you can ask for" 
A,[t]love the g2 
A,low light focus[-],"the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds" 
A,picture[-],"got way too many blurry pictures" 
A,photo[+] use[+] software[+],"4mp  4x optical zoom  takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras  easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen )  a lot of features and add-on options  comes with great software ( not to be overlooked )  and last but by far not least  received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) 
A,[t]upgraded from g2 and not looking back 
A,camera[+],"the powershot g3 is a great camera" 
A,photo[+],"because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 
A,camera[+],"4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros  and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera" 
A,feature[+],"it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features" 
A,unresponsiveness[-],"the catch with the canon g3 camera  ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots" 
A,delay[-][u],"it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button" 
A,delay[-][u],"canon 's g3 does it consistently" 
A,focus[-] shoot[-],"it feels slow to focus  and unbearably slow to shoot" 
A,g3[-],"unfortunately  this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted" 
A,[t]100 % happy 
A,camera[+],"this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier" 
A,picture quality[+],"i love the quality of the pictures" 
A,picture quality[+][p],"they look fantastic" 
A,[t]the best 4mp out there 
A,4mp camera[+],"the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there" 
A,picture[+],"with canon  you get pictures that appear to be photos  not still camcorder shots" 
A,control[+]menu[+],"i love the eos based controls and easy menus" 
A,lens cap[-],"1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera" 
A,body[-],"2 ) the body construction - buttons  casing  etc  are too plastic" 
A,casing[-],"it had a heavier and more sturdy casing" 
A,performance[+][p],"i bought it for my trip to beunos aires  and also used it at the iguazu falls  and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! 
A,camera[+],"this camera is worth every penny  and i highly recommend it ! 
A,battery life[+],"another point of note , the battery life is incredible ! 
A,camera[+],"am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
A,camera[+],"i 've only had it a week  but so far  everything about this camera is making me happy" 
A,menu[+],"very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera" 
A,battery[+],"the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging" 
A,optical zoom[+]viewfinder[+],"the optical zoom is awesome  and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom" 
A,viewfinder[-],"one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder  but does not detract from the image at all" 
A,camera[+],"the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use" 
A,camera[+],"because this camera is beautiful" 
A,look[+],"the g3 looks like a work of art ! 
A,finish[+],"its silver magnesium finish is stunning  and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen" 
A,camera[+][p],"i am very pleased with it so far" 
A,viewfinder[-],"you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder" 
A,tiff format[-],"( i knew this before hand  and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format" 
A,lag[-],"it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? 
A,import[+],"it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop" 
A,camera[+],"i am quite happy with the camera" 
A,manual[+],"it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep" 
A,camera[+][p],"yes  i recommend it over the competition" 
A,camera[+],"best camera ever" from the image quality  color  function  i can say almost everything" 
A,stitch picture[+],"this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature  to find out more just log on to canon 's website" 
A,picture[+],"first and foremost  it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's" 
A,camera[+],"this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time" 
A,camera[+],"however  for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget  i think this camera is an excellent choice" 
A,design[+] feature[+]use[+][u]battery[+],"it has a beautiful design  lots of features  very easy to use  very configurable and customizable  and the battery duration is amazing ! 
A,display[+],"also  the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions  or to protect it against any damage" 
A,compactflash[-],"one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card  and for most purposes  it is not enough" 
A,noise[+],"another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen" 
A,camera[+],"i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything" 
A,camera[+],"it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera". 
A,use[+][u]design[+][u],"in general it is easy to use and well laid out" 
A,use[+]control[+],"it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly" 
A,feature[+],"the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography" 
A,auto mode[+],"in the hands of someone who does n't  it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode" 
A,memory card[-],"the included memory card is too small" 
A,made[-],"it is made of plastic" 
A,lens[-],"the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot" 
A,size[-][u],"while light  it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets" 
A,lever[-],"the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile" 
A,flash[-],"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras  you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost" 
A,strap[-],"the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to" 
A,camera[+],"the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing" 
A,option[+} control[+],"canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out" 
A,learning[+],"learning how to use it will not take very long" 
A,image quality[+],"the image quality is excellent" 
A,function[+],"range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone , point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography" 
A,camera[+],"this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used" 
A,macro[+] auto mode[+],"the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot" 
A,camera[+],"this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4- megapixel" 
A,4mp resolution[+],"i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; 
A,distortion[-][u],"yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away )  canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture" 
A,shot[+],"in terms of the shots taken  this camera is insanely great ! 
A,picture[+]learning curve[+],"the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to" 
A,picture quality[+],"i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow  car  boat and wind" 
A,[t]canon g3 review / response / recommendation 
A,camera[+],"the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood" 
A,picture[+]feel[+][u],"it takes great pictures  operates quickly  and feels solid" 
A,viewfinder[-],"to address two previous somewhat negative reviews , ( 1 ) yes  the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however  the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder" 
A,design[-],"this camera has a major design flaw" 
A,viewfinder[-],"when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens" 
A,camera[+],"everything else about the camera is great" 
A,camera[+],"if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder  i highly recommend the camera" 
A,camera[+][u],"and so far  i 've been very pleased" 
A,lens[+]optical zoom[+],"the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light  and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer" 
A,lcd[+],"the moveable lcd screen is great" 
A,remote[+],"the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful , not only does it trigger the shutter  it can also be used to zoom and review pictures" 
A,hot shoe flash[+],"the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit , 
A,battery[+],"i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330  but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse , 
A,battery charging system[+],"the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras , the battery needs to be charged while in the camera  but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery" 
A,manual[+],"i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options , shutter priority  aperature priority  light metering adjustments  etc.  but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear" 
A,highlight[-],"i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330  and the g3 seems to do only slightly better" 
A,no-off button[-],"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy  and has an awkward  tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera" 
A,body[-],"and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic  a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330" 
A,download[+],"i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly  but there 's no difference in working with the files" 
A,camera[+],"i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it" 
A,camera[+]use[+]photo[+],"very comfortable camera  easy to use  and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price" 
A,[t]best non-slr digital camera under 5 megapixels 
A,g3[+],"i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised" 
A,camera[+],"all-in-all  i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market" 
A,optic[+],"canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better" 
A,digital camera[+],"simply  the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point" 
A,battery life[+],"the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen" 
A,look[-],"the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking  it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap  and it is a bit slow between shots" 
A,camera[+],"even with these shortcomings  i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200" 
A,[t]great camera but g2 will do the same for less 
A,camera[+],"definetely a great camera" 
A,quality[+]lens[+],"proven canon built quality and lens" 
A,feel[+],"feels solid in hand" 
A,weight[-]camera[+],"rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros" 
E,affordability[+],"while  there are flaws with the machine  the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability" 
E,bang-for-the-buck[+][u],"it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there" 
E,size[+]weight[+]navigational system[+] sound[+],"like it 's predecessor  the quickly revised nx  this player boasts a decent size and weight  a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags  and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business )" 
E,screen[+],"the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger  now-blue backlit screen  which is infinitely better" 
E,deal[+],"i chose this one because from what i read  it was the best deal for the money" 
E,wma file[+],"another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it" 
E,software[+],"the software is great" 
E,software[+],"transfering is easy  the software makes everythig pretty easy" 
E,battery life[+],"even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours  it 's actually a little less but still good" 
E,accessory[-],"only 1 problem  no accessories".. yet" 
E,remote[-],"i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet  but being without a remote is hard" 
E,interface[+],"they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use" 
E,player[+][p],"get it  it 's woth every penny ! ! 
E,player[+][p],"i 've had it for a week now  do n't regret the purchase one bit  and i never leave home without it" 
E,software[+],"software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better  but costs money ) 
E,price[+],"much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player  some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on  but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate 
E,headphone[-],"you 're going to need to buy new headphones  the stock ones suck 
E,sound[+],"the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s" 
E,navigation[-],"navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well" 
E,weight[+],"at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod" 
E,battery[+]leather case[+],"the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus )" 
E,software[+],"so far the software for the pc works easily" 
E,looking[+],"by the way  it looks nice also" 
E,player[+][p],"it 's worth it" 
E,battery life[+]price[+],"my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price , i found both" 
E,sound[+] headphone[-],"the sound is excellent  but a tip , get a real pair of headphones" 
E,control[+],"the controls are on the side instead of on the front  which i like  because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! 
E,scroll wheel[+],"the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad" 
E,size[-],"it could be a little bit bigger  but it 's easy to get used to" 
E,screen[-],"the screen may be a little smaller  but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue" 
E,firewire[-],"it does n't have firewire  not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves" 
E,leather pouch[+],"the included leather pouch is a big plus , it actually protects the unit well  something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices" 
E,battery[+]construction[+]size[+]weight[+],"other plusses , changable battery  loads of presets for environments  decent construction  still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod" 
E,size[+][u]sound[+]price[+],"overall , small  sounds great  and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! 
E,battery[+],"( batteries last longer too ! ) 
E,player[+] price[+],"the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player" 
E,player[+],"i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen  and used  ever" 
E,menu[+],"the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online  then you can do the same with the zen" 
E,screen[+],"the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night  but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long" 
E,player[+]use[+] software[+]sound[+],"all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away  with easy to use and understand features  software that is simple to understand and use  and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player )" 
E,program[+],"it 's a very intuitive program" 
E,installation[+],"i had no problems following their installation instructions" 
E,menu[+],"the menus are very easy to navigate" 
E,scroll wheel[-],"the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select  you have to push straight in or it sticks" 
E,control[+],"the other controls are all very easy to use" 
E,play option[+],"it has several play options  one of the best is an option to shuffle  based on all or a certain playlist" 
E,playlist[-],"the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad  it has to be done from the computer" 
E,price[+][u],"it also costs a lot less than the ipod" 
E,earbud[+],"the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad" 
E,earbud[+][p],"they 're pretty comfortable  stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality" 
E,deal[+],"this is a good deal for music and data storage" 
E,software[-],"the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software" 
E,software[-],"the interface software itself  which should be user-friendly  was anything but easy-to-use" 
E,player[-],"the player itself has all sorts of problems" 
E,face plate[-],"the face-plate  which pops out for the battery  pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so" 
E,file transfer[-],"the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while  prompting a reset" 
E,scroll[-],"the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others" 
E,scroll[-],"depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive" 
E,scroll[-],"the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating" 
E,sound[+],"on the positive side  the sound of the player is pretty good  once you have everything configured" 
E,audio[+],"i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit  but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory  as should be expected from creative labs" 
E,player[-],"overall  a very disappointing product" 
E,setup[-]interface[-],"the setup process for the nomad is infuriating  and the interface with the player is sub-par" 
E,player[-],"the player 's mechanics are also flawed" 
E,player[-],"although the sound-quality is good  it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product" 
E,price[+],"when it came down to it  the price on this player is hard to beat" 
E,scroll[-],"one beef is the scroll  it does n't work as well as i 'd like" 
E,this thing[+],"other than that this thing is great".. 
E,battery[+],"zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod" 
E,battery[+],"the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery  just like any other battery-powered appliance" 
E,earphone[-]software[-],"deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ). 
E,screen[+]switch[-],"the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement  but the toggle switch is still tricky" 
E,[t] terrific mp3 player  great price" 
E,nomad[+],"i love my new nomad  its great ! 
E,price[+],"for some this might be a problem  but for the price of a 30 gig ipod  you can get a 60gb nomad  the ipod simply pales in comparison" 
E,software[+],"the software is very easy to use  and within 30 minutes of opening my box  i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds" 
E,case[+],"the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective  and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones )" 
E,headphone[-] sound[+],"on the subject of headphones  this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box  but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof ! 
E,deal[+] mp3 player[+],"but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player  get the nomad" 
E,player[+][u],"best electronic i 've bought since i was born" 
E,set up[+],"so easy to set up  had some problems with my archos" 
E,nomad explorer[+],"just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking  by artist  song title  genre  etc. 
E,player[+][p]look[+][u],"not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast  but it is also eye candy" 
E,design[+][u],"very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has" 
E,leather case[+],"the leather case it comes with is pretty nice  similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly" 
E,button[+],"all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand" 
E,sound quality[+],"the sound quality is also nice".. after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with" 
E,sound option[+],"lots of sound options  has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options" 
E,navigation[+],"navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch" 
E,navigation[+],"also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player" 
E,screen saver[+],"oh  and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^ 
E,file limit[+],"another plus in my book  no file limits ! 
E,playlist[+],"i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up" 
E,storage[+][u],"i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder" 
E,player[+][u],"i really have no complaints over this unit" 
E,player[+],"i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player" 
E,installation[-],"getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience" 
E,manual[-],"also  the instruction manual is very bad" 
E,player[+],"i have no complaints with this mp3 player" 
E,file transfer[+][u],"getting files onto it is quick and painless" 
E,sorting[+],"then sorting the files is easy as pie" 
E,storage[+][u],"and it holds sooooo much music and audio files" 
E,player[+][p],"my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems" 
E,sound[+]earphone[-],"also  the sound is wonderful".. my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with" 
E,battery[+],"the battery is nice" 
E,screen[+],"the lcd screen was very large and readable" 
E,player[+],"compared to everything else in this category  this is most definately the best bang for the buck" 
E,zen[+],"i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class" 
E,transfer[-],"transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0" 
E,transfer[-],"it would only transfer 30 or so songs  and then come up with an error" 
E,scroll wheel[-],"scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter  but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling" 
E,size[-],"size - bigger than the ipod 
E,software[-],"software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest  the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut" 
E,sound quality[+],"sound quality was the same between the two  but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features" 
E,player[+],"i love this player" 
E,player[-][p],"all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once  but it has n't done it since" 
E,player[+],"i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again" 
E,software[+],"the software was great  as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp )" 
E,player[+],"anyway  this player is a great deal and i really love it" 
E,size[-][u]weight[-][u]look[-]folder structure[-],"first  the cons".. a tad bulky".. not the most asthetic looking player".. and does n't support a folder stucture" 
E,price[+][u],"way less expensive than the ipod" 
E,interface[+],"i find it pretty easy to use".. and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc )"." 
E,folder structure[-],"the cons are n't really a big deal to me".. except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files".. no folder structure".. and it 's based on the title of the songs".. many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc )".. and a few had same titles".. so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another" 
E,chinese name[-],"and man".. i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player".. because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title". 
E,transfer[+],"not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless" 
E,xtra[+][u],"bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago  and so far it has been excellent" 
E,storage[+][u],"i still have over 19gb left  and already have over 200 cd 's on it" 
E,interface[+][p]software[+][p],"both are very easy to learn & use  and intuitive enough for even a novice" 
E,transfer[+],"ripping & transferring tunes is basic  and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb )" 
E,case[+],"people also have complained about the case not having a window  but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection" 
E,case[+][p],"it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to" 
E,sound quality[+]look[+]screen[+] battery[+],"the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff )  the unit looks cool  screen is bright and easy to read  and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price  but everyone knows that )" 
E,option[+],"you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets  navigating options  playlists  etc )" 
E,button[-],"the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing" 
E,button[-],"my " fast forward " button works  but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go" 
E,button[+],"all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well" 
E,support[+],"but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it  and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary"." 
E,size[-],"sure  it 's a little bigger than the ipod  but not by much" 
E,size[+][u]weight[+],"it still fits in the palm of your hand  and it 's not heavy" 
E,product[+][u]price[+],"bottom line".. great product  unbeatable price" 
E,id3 tag[-],"unlike my 3 other mp3 players  this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks" 
E,id3 tag[-],"if you do n't have tags  it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders" 
E,player[+][u],"i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it" 
E,setup[2] transfer[+],"the setup and transfer process was cake for me" 
E,transfer[-][u],"i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem" 
E,explorer[-],"the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything  just open up explorer again" 
E,player[-],"the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well" 
E,player[+],"now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems" 
E,screen[+],"the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it" 
E,eax mode[+],"the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides" 
E,jog dial[-],"the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it" 
E,mp3 player[+],"all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player" 
E,nomad[+],"i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! 
E,installation[-],"i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver" 
E,software[+],"i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy" 
E,playlist[+],"ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier" 
E,mediasource[+],"i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer" 
E,playback quality[+],"being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable" 
E,sound[+][u],"when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! 
E,sound quality[+],"the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior" 
E,nomad[+],"actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated" 
E,finding[+],"finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy" 
E,screen[+],"the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight" 
E,use[+] playback quality[+]price[+],"i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software )  playback quality and value for the price" 
E,player[+][p],"just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date" 
E,size[+],"nice palm sized unit  somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something" 
E,sound quality[+],"all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod  archos  dell  samsung )" 
E,eax[+],"the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative" 
E,player[-],"i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio  but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment" 
E,control[-],"- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones" 
E,fly wheel[-],"the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use" 
E,button[-],"the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
E,software[-],"- included creative software is pretty poor" 
E,price[+],"- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price 
E,sound[+],"- best in class sound 
E,screen[+],"- large easy readable screen 
E,play[-],"i tried to play the song three times  with no success" 
E,play[-],"it would either not play the song at all  or skip wildly  no matter that the unit was resting on my desk" 
E,software[-],"had there been strange noises  or obvious defects  i would have accepted a replacement  but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches" 
E,player[+][p],"working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! ! 
E,player[+][p],"i love it ! ! 
E,player[-][p],"this product is too fragile for normal use" 
E,software[+],"i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred" 
E,software[-],"however  the creative software is not real intuitive" 
E,software[-],"the software is somewhat nice to look at  using it is not the easiest" 
E,rename[-],"if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred  you will become frustrated quite quickly" 
E,transfer[+],"transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0" 
E,sound[+],"it is great sounding  even with the supplied earbuds" 
E,earbud[+],"i must have differing preferences than others here  as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players" 
E,storage[+],"i love the storage in this thing" 
E,warranty[-][p],"this is ridiculous" 
E,scroll wheel[-],"the scroll wheel  to be blunt  sucks" 
E,scroll wheel[-][p],"seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection" 
E,interface[-],"the interface used could be better designed" 
E,interface[-][p],"it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want" 
E,case[-],"and the case  how did this ever make it out of quality control" 
E,case[-][p],"it is some protection for the unit  but for useability  forget it" 
E,control[-],"the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls  especially the scroll wheel" 
E,player[+][p],"despite the things that i have listed so far  i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work  to the gym  in the car  etc." 
E,lock up[-],"however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times" 
E,firmware[-],"quite simply  the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time" 
E,warranty[-],"i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it  since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! 
E,player[+],"this is my second creative labs mp3 player  and it is definitely a fine product" 
E,size[-]weight[-],"1" the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod  and it weighs a little bit more" 
E,scroll[-],"2" the scroll button is n't the best  as it sometimes can be hard to select" 
E,sound quality[+],"first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod" 
E,software[+],"the player 's software is very easy to use and very good" 
E,software[+],"compared to musicmatch  the software has a better filing system and easier to use" 
E,player[+][p],"to keep it short  this is cheaper  and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod" 
E,player[+],"this thing seriously is a good player though" 
E,unit[+],"overall i like the unit" 
E,player[-][p],"i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft )" 
E,price[+],"1 ) price / gb of storage 
E,storage[+],"2 ) storage capacity 
E,battery[+],"3 ) user replaceable battery 
E,construction[-][u],"1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ) 
E,scroll[-],"2 ) scroll button / switch 
E,case[-],"3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing" 
E,player[+][p],"overall i like it" 
E,storage[+],"the storage capacity is great" 
E,price[+],"the price compared to the ipod is great" 
E,price[+]battery[+],"price  along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad" 
E,itunes[-],"but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes" 
E,scroll[-],"the scroll bar is a bit of a pain" 
E,software[+],"i 've had no problems with the software" 
E,software[+][p],"i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes )" 
E,software[+][p],"this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem" 
E,software[+],"the software comes with plenty of defaults genres" 
E,sound[+],"the sound from the player is ok" 
E,sound[-],"i was a little disappointed in the low end" 
E,sound[-],"the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected" 
E,this thing[+],"this thing is great  i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records" 
E,storage[+],"one good thing  it is 40 gb of disk space ( well  it is 38 gb in reality )" 
E,price[+]feature[+],"for the price and features it is really good" 
E,navigation[-],"in any case  navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders" 
E,navigation[-],"you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre  no other division" 
E,software[-],"the software  which comes with player is not good at all" 
E,nomad explorer[-],"i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work" 
E,software[-],"so yes  as with all software bundled with creative products  it was useless and ugly" 
E,zen[+],"the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks  spills my beer  but does n't wash my car" 
E,battery life[+]online music service[+]pc compatibility[+],"longer battery life  greater accessibility to online music services  and pc compatibility are the sensibilities" 
E,player[+],"i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it" 
E,sound[+]battery life[+]price[+][u],"the sound is excellent  the battery life is excellent  the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent  and finally the price  $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod  is excellent" 
E,style[+]size[+][u]control[+],"the nomad is not ugly  it is not that big  it comfortably fits in my pocket  or heavy  and the controls are not hard to get used to" 
E,player[+][p],"so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance  also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing" 
E,player[-][p],"this thing is trash" 
E,construction[-][u],"a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily  and it definately wouldnt survive a drop 
E,screen[-],"b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 
E,scroll[-],"c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said 
E,software[-],"d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate  crashes frequently  screwed my music library up  doesnt work with mp4s  the list goes on and on 
E,case[-],"e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 
E,look[-],"f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash  you want something that has the asthetics bit down  of course 
E,software[-],"the software failed repeatedly" 
E,customer support website[-],"creative labs customer support website is useless" 
E,software[-],"software downloads on the site crashed my pc" 
E,[t] great mp3 player" 
E,player[+],"i just bought this player today and i already love it" 
E,play[-],"it has a few inconveniences , one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd" 
E,scroll[-],"another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long  it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on" 
E,player[+],"otherwise  this player is awesome ! 
E,screen[+],"it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily" 
E,volume range[+],"the volume range is great  so you can blast it if you want" 
E,player[+],"overall  this player is awesome and i definately recommend it" 
E,this item[+][p],"i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards" 
E,price[+],"naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net )  and price-wise zens are unbeatable" 
E,value[+],"compared to other leading hdd mp3 players  the value per gb is the tops" 
E,sound quality[+],"- sound quality , excellent  everything you would expect from this company" 
E,use[+][u],"- the unit is easy to use and intuitive" 
E,uploading[+],"- uploading music is quick and easy" 
E,software[+],"although the supplied software can be annoying at times  on whole it is excellent" 
E,player[+][p]button[+],"- the unit itself its well structured  with just the buttons you need and none you do n't" 
E,scroll[+],"as often mentioned  the scroll tab is average  however  not difficult to use or horrible" 
E,screen[+],"the screen is large  defined  and easy to read  and the silver unit is naturally cool" 
E,feature[+],"there are lots of interesting features included such as eax  and customization" 
E,battery[+],"- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do )  you will be able to buy another easily" 
E,battery life[+],"also  the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy" 
E,equipment[+],"- equipment included is average  but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for" 
E,case[-],"the case is strong and stylish  but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal )" 
E,headphone[+],"the headphone earbuds are average  so just use your regular pair instead" 
E,player[+],"this player is an ideal purchase" 
E,player[+]software[-],"the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt" 
E,player[+],"i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player" 
E,software[-],"on my main computer the software did not work right" 
E,customer support[-],"i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all" 
E,player[+],"i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic" 
E,player[+],"so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost" 
E,zx[+][p],"i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review" 
E,size[+][u],"it is small overall  bigger than the ipod  but keep in mind that this is because different  less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx" 
E,sound quality[+],"the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod  however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so" 
E,lcd[+],"the lcd is larger than the previous model  the nx  and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did" 
E,scroll wheel[+],"the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me  however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate" 
E,sound[+],"the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product" 
E,eax[+],"the included eax support is useful at times  especially when you listen to a variety of genres  as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle" 
E,enviromental audio[-],"the environmental audio  however  is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-56 kbps without variable bit rates" ) 
E,signal to noise ratio[+],"the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable  useful data to unusable garbage in  say  a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles  and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods" 
E,software[+],"the software has n't been a hassle for me at all" 
E,price[+],"lastly  the price is fantastic , 
E,software[+],"i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems" 
E,usb 2.0[+],"usb 2.0 - very fast 
E,earbud[-],"yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap  replace them" 
E,sound[+],"but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers" 
E,recharger[+],"and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ). 
E,look[+]size[+][u]weight[+][u],"it looks very cool  and seems quite small to me and very light" 
E,scroll[+],"the scroll button seems ok  i have no problems with it" 
E,player[+][u],"i am very pleased so far" 
E,use[+],"very simple to use" 
E,battery[-],"1 ) a spare battery would have been great" 
E,game[-],"2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it" 
E,work[-],"3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer  like some players 
E,use[+],"all in all suprisingly easy to use" 
E,sound quality[+]size[+]price[+],"lots of flaws  but exceptional sound quality  hd size  and price make it a good buy" 
E,sound[+],"excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox" 
E,transfer[+],"transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk  so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad" 
E,transfer[+],"i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer" 
E,storage[+],"huge storage space - even at 320kbs  you can store a ton of songs on this thing" 
E,transfer[+],"having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers" 
E,navigation[-],"navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs" 
E,fm receiver[-],"fm receiver - it has none" 
E,construction[-],"cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners" 
E,feel[-],"the player feels very delicate  as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive" 
E,feel[-],"as a portable player  it should feel a bit more durable" 
E,play[-],"the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd" 
E,software[-],"software - the software is crap" 
E,rip cd[+],"i use it for ripping cds  which it does a pretty good job of" 
E,software[-][p],"otherwise  it is difficult to figure out and awkward" 
E,instruction[-],"even after reading some of the instructions  it 's still hard to figure out" 
E,line out jack[-],"no line out jack - as i said  there is none" 
E,line out jack[-],"it sounds decent  but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack" 
E,control[-],"controls are a bit awkward" 
E,control[-][u],"it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman" 
E,headphone[-],"crappy headphones" 
E,earbud[-],"the included earbuds were uncomfortable" 
E,navigation[-],"difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult  " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate" 
E,navigation[-],"it is a bit cumbersome  and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly" 
E,navigation[-][p],"i think this is it 's biggest flaw" 
E,control[-],"up  down  left  and right would have given me better control" 
E,scroll wheel[-],"if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through )  it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it" 
E,case[-],"it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen  and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack" 
E,case[-],"as it stands now  the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel  or if you load up all your songs beforehand" 
E,player[+][p],"overall  i feel that it 's a decent buy  and am happy that i own it" 
E,sound[+] price[+] player[-],"i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price  although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement" 
E,price[+],"for the price and size and features  you can 't beat the price" 
E,button[+]interface[+],"the buttons and interface are very easy to use" 
E,click buttons[+] display[+],"simple click buttons  back buttons volume and display are very easy to read  access and use" 
E,software[-],"but the major problem i had was with the software" 
E,instruction[-],"the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple" 
E,sync[-],"the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful" 
E,transfer[-],"i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused" 
E,mp3 player[+],"with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod" 
E,interface[+],"i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer" 
E,product[+],"i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product" 
E,software[+],"the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine" 
E,headphone[-],"the headphones are n't the best  but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity" 
E,battery life[+],"the battery life seems good  takes very lttle time to charge  it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs" 
E,navigation[+],"took me a few tries to get use to the navigation  but it 's a very user friendly player imo" 
E,player[+],"i have n't messed with the firmware at all  the player worked perfect for me right out of the box" 
E,product[+],"all-in-all  this is another excellent creative product" 
E,size[+][u]weight[+][u]look[+]display[+],"it 's small  light and nice looking and the display is decent as well" 
E,product[+],"i would recommend this product to anyone" 
E,player[+],"before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one  and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there" 
E,software[+],"many people have written about the software being its one downfall  personally i have n't had a single problem with the software  i 'm running windows me" 
E,cd rip[+],"the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy  and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player  so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive" 
E,software[+],"the software runs smooth  it 's nice to look at  it 's very organized  easy to follow and makes things very simple" 
E,control[+],"the controls on the player are very simple  no need for a manual" 
E,player[+]sound[+],"the player is fast and sounds great  it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music  or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium" 
E,battery[+],"the battery lasts very long when playing music  but writing files to the player drains the battery fast  so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files" 
E,playlist[+],"playlists can be made on the fly  without aid of a computer  and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists" 
E,software[+]player[+],"the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream  i could n't give this anything but a 5  i wish there was a 6" 
E,player[+][p],"it is an extremely cool gizmo" 
E,navigation[+]scroll[-],"the navigation is nice enough  but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks  hundreds of albums or artists  or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving" 
E,playlist[-],"creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked" 
E,sound quality[-],"my only significant complaint is sound quality" 
E,eax[-],"the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq" 
E,sound quality[-],"i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost" " 
E,product[+],"well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket" 
E,product[+],"well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price )" 
E,program[-],"well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it  it will be a breeze" 
E,price[+][u] player[+],"not only is it more affordable  but its a better player for windows  which is what i have" 
E,battery life[+],"it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it )  so the battery life seems fine ( so far ). 
E,id3 tag[-],"my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them" 
E,transfer[+],"oh".. and file transfers are fast & easy" 
E,weight[-],"a little weighty ( 9 ounces".. no biggie )  but otherwise fine" 
E,scroll wheel[+],"it 's easy" 
E,button[+],"the buttons are easy to use  and its easy to navigate" 
E,backlight[+],"the big backlight makes things easy to see  and the writing is big enough for people to see" 
E,eax[+],"my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature" 
E,eax[+][p],"its really cool" 
E,sound quality[+],"sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse  but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality )" 
E,song speed[+],"you can also slow a song down & speed it up  which is cool too" 
E,earbud[-],"but the earbuds suck ! 
E,case[-],"i forgot  the case does n't fit" 
E,case[-],"my case doesnt close".. maybe mine was just faulty  but the case isnt that great" 
E,storage[+][u],"also  you can store data on it  which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod  do n't bother  this is a much better buy" 
E,player hardware[+],"first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good"." 
E,sound[+]size[-][u],"the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected )"." 
E,software[-],"what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software" 
E,bookmark[-],"bookmarks for example  are an excellent feature".. but not on this player"." 
E,bookmakr[-],"rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area  the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made"" 
E,bookmark[-],"this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks"." 
E,playlist[-],"the dynamic playlists ( " now playing "  i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate"." 
E,price[+][u],"while the ease of use was very impressive  i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player" 
E,nomad[+],"i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now  and i am very happy with it" 
E,weight[-][u]battery life[+],"it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod  and has a longer battery life" 
E,storage capacity[+],"the storage capacity is great for me -- 
E,control[-],"the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod  but i have gotten use to them  and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price" 
E,load[-][u],"loading cds was somewhat time-consuming  but i think it would have been with the ipod as well" 
E,tag[-]software[-],"my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software" 
E,tag[-],"other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system" 
E,software[-],"also  i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order" 
E,playlist[-],"finally  making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually  and are organized by cd  which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order" 
E,product[+][p],"the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product" 
E,software[+],"a lot of people complain about the creative software  but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes" 
E,sync[+],"first  the zen lets you sync to more than one computer" 
E,shuttle[+],"the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources  you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player )" 
E,sync[+],"second  the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer" 
E,player[+],"the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player" 
E,software[+],"third  creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer" 
E,cd burner[-],"only thing missing from creative is a cd burner" 
E,creative[+],"for those of us that like to tinker  i think creative offers some advantages" 
E,scroll[+],"zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player" 
E,remove[+],"it also lets you remove songs from the play order" 
E,delete[+],"if you bring up an album  but absolutely hate some of the tracks  the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order" 
E,zen[+][p],"its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus. 
E,this thing[+][p],"i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since" 
E,control[-]look[-],"the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's  or as " sexy " looking" 
E,software[+],"the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered" 
E,headphone[-],"as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! 
E,the unit[+],"the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! 
E,unit[+],"overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it" 
E,[t] review for folks new to mp3s" 
E,size[+],"this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size" 
E,case[+],"it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly" 
E,cover[-],"the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on  the device still feels pretty solid" 
E,software[+][u],"extremely convenient" 
E,price[+],"great price" 
E,software[+],"i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all" 
E,scroll[-],"the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh  not a big deal" 
E,size[-][u],"it is slightly larger than an ipod  no doubt about it" 
E,player[+][p],"i 'm really happy with this purchase" 
E,size[-],"i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size" 
E,screen[+]equilizer[+],"now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things , the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect  fast as hell in music transfer  controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button  great sound and ive heard many mp3 players  a ton of different equilizer type deals on here" 
E,size[-][u]weight[+]software[-],"there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious , a little larger than other mp3s but still light  the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-5 mins )  and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall" 
E,case[+],"but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything" 
E,price[+]sound[+],"ive seen em all  the archos  dell  ipods  everything".. good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion" 
E,weight[-][u]size[-][u],"its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket" 
E,playlist[-],"its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists  phone numbers  address books  ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device )" 
E,battery life[-],"it also has unproven battery life" 
E,software[-],"finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels  first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks  flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store  which  if you ever plan to pay for your music  is by far the best" 
E,price[+]capacity[+],", price and capacity 
E,design[+]interface[+],", slick-looking design and improved interface 
E,battery[+],", removable battery 
E,case[-],", protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window" 
E,scroll[-],", scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models" 
E,eax[-],", eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files" 
E,volume[-],", does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones  or external receivers ( car radio ). 
E,software[-],", software is absolutely terrible , 
E,transfer[-],"-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums  this will cause you inordinate frustration ). 
E,recognition[-],"-- > does not recognize player at random times  despite being connected and displaying player 's library" 
E,change[-],"-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks" 
E,software[-],"-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best" 
E,player[+]software[-] rip[-] transfer[-],"a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be" 
E,size[+][u],"despite its being slightly larger than the ipod  i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! 
E,cd rip[+],"i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-5 mb per cd  good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57000 mb of free memory available to me" 
E,transfter[+],"file transfers are fast  nearly a song per second via usb 2.0" 
E,software[-],"my one issue with the mediasource software is that  despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service  the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field" 
E,sound[+],"to my ears  a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd  and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player" 
E,eax[+],"the eax features are pretty cool  as well  as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that  for example  compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train" 
E,navigation[-],"navigation could be better  but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it" 
E,player[+],"at the end of the day  what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go  and the zen xtra 's combination of price  capacity and features easily meets those criteria" 
E,this[+][p],"i got this for christmas  and it is a great gift" 
E,use[+],"i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks  and the ease of use is wonderful" 
E,memory[+],"the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs  my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun" 
E,battery[+]sound[+],"plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad" 
E,software[-]case[-],"the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system  and the traveling case it comes with" 
E,rip[+] quality[+],"ripping the songs  even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick  and the quality is very good" 
E,player[+],"considering the price and specs  this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player" 
E,sound quality[+],"it 's really a shame  because otherwise  creative mp3 players are very good  and have the best sound quality of any players on the market" 
E,zen xtra[+],"after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative  and i have not been disappointed" 
E,battery[+],"first  the battery is replacable by the user  because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod" 
E,battery[+],"it was easy enough to remove the front plate  and there was only one way the battery could be inserted" 
E,software[+],"the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use" 
E,playlist[+]cd rip[+],"you can create playlists  drag & drop songs and playlists to your player  and rip directly from cd to your player" 
E,transfer[+],"and with usb 2.0  transferring music to your player is incredibly easy" 
E,sound[+]volume[+],"the sound is great  and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise" 
E,earbud[+],"i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it  but the included earbuds work quite well" 
E,earbud[+][p],"they could be more comfortable  but no complaints in the sound department" 
E,equalizer[+],"i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too" 
E,clip[-],"however  i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off" 
E,case[-],"also  the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display  so even though the side controls are reachable  i have to open it up to see the display" 
E,player[-]software[-],"this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues" 
E,storage[+][u],"1" i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more" 
E,stoppage[+],"the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click" 
E,software[-],"1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip  catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? 
E,mediasource[-],"mediasource did not recognize my tags ! 
E,eax[-],"2" despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality  i experienced a flaw using eax" 
E,eax[-],"creative are , the , sound people for computers  i can 't understand why eax would introduce static" 
E,mediasource[-],"3" mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws" 
E,folder structure[-],"4"the zen , stores , data files  but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched )" 
E,storage[-],"in other words  the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information )" 
E,stop button[-],"5" the zen does not have a stop button ! 
E,manual[-],"but this is , not documented , in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version" 
E,usb recharge[-],"6" the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic  but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice" 
E,mediasource[-],"7" mediasource did not install on my personal notebook" 
E,notmad[+],"m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp  but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! 
E,software[+],"given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software" 
E,player[+][p],"now that i own it  however  i can 't imagine being without it ! 
E,memory[+][u],"i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory" 
E,sound quality[+],"the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! 
E,navigation[+],"it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device" 
E,operate[+][u],"i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive" 
E,software[-],"the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated" 
E,napster[+],"one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software" 
E,name[-],"they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long )" 
E,player[-][p],"i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason" 
E,storage[+][u],"+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering" 
E,musicmatch software[+],"+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit 
E,screen[+],"+ screen was good  easy to read 
E,sound quality[+],"+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great" 
E,software[-],"- the software that came with it was tough to load" 
E,battery top[-],"- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch" 
E,top[-],"the top did not fit well into the unit" ( felt defective ) 
E,cover[-],"- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well 
E,flywheel[-],"- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage" 
E,construction[-][p],"- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last" 
E,zen xtra[+],"i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra".. and i was not disappointed" 
E,player[+]sound quality[+],"the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality" 
E,navigation[+]sync[+],"navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too" 
E,software[+],"many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective" 
E,player[+],"i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision" 
E,construction[-],"the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly  leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player" 
E,construction[-],"i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for" 
E,[t] the 3 ( ? ! ) month warranty should be a warning" 
E,price[+],"the price / performance looked just right" 
E,headphone jack[-],"i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose" 
E,construction[-],"i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because  as other reviewers have pointed out  the construction is pretty flimsy" 
E,installation[-],"like other reviewers  installation was hell" 
E,software[-][p],"about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc" 
E,online help[-],"after i had it a couple weeks  it got into a state where it could never find the device  no matter how often i rebooted my pc  reset the device  reloaded drivers  etc  etc. creative 's online support was no help at all" 
E,player[-][p],"in fact  i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered" 
E,installation[-][u],"to my amazement  even that process was error-prone" 
E,things[-][p],"it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why" 
E,notmad software[+],"i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement" 
E,nomad[-],"my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be  at best  a 40gb portable hard drive  albeit one on which i can 't create folders  or  at worst  a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating )" 
E,creative product[-],"i will never buy a creative product again" 
E,thing[-],"i purchased a jukebox  it got fried while being recharged  they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing" 
E,sound[+]power output[+],"1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers" 
E,volume[+],"with my sennheiser 497 headphones  the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 )" 
E,player[+],"the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers" 
E,user interface[+]navigation[+],"2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use  and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection" 
E,nomad explorer[+],"3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player" 
E,nomad explorer[+],"the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad" 
E,usb 2.0[+],"4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). 
E,battery[+],"5 ) the cheap  user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace" 
E,battery life[+],"6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's" 
E,look[+]build[+],"7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate" 
E,player[+][p],"i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine" 
E,mediasource[+],"8 ) creative mediasource  although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer  is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ). 
E,id3 tag[+],"i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags" 
E,cd rip[+],"b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive" 
E,sync[+],"c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer" 
E,wake up[+],"9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time" 
E,play mode[+],"10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album  shuffle  etc.  is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter" 
E,pause[+],"11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player 
E,storage[+],"12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs  491 albums and counting ) ! 
E,plug and play[-],"1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it" 
E,id3[-],"2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre  artist  album  etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information" 
E,folder[-],"3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files" 
E,fm[-]voice recording[-],"4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras" 
E,accessory[-],"5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing" 
E,case[-],"6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed" 
E,flip switch[+],"7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch" 
E,sound[+]interface[+]battery[+]software[+] wake up[+]play mode[+],"great sound ; good interface ; replaceable  powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up  sleep timers ; multiple play modes 
E,plug and play[-]id3[-]fm[-]recording[-],"not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording 
E,storage[+][u],"can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go" 
E,wake up[+],"also love waking up to music with attached speakers" 
E,headphone jack[-],"so  i 've had it for a month  and the headphone jack went out" 
E,creative[-][p],"nothing but hassle with this company" 
E,shuffle[+],"i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com. 
E,battery[+],"replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150" 
E,cover[-],"the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck" 
E,weight[-][u],"it 's kinda heavy  kinda like having a walkman" 
E,headphone[-],"headphones suck  i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature" 
E,software[-],"the software sucks" 
E,feature[-],"also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate" 
E,headphone jack[-],"i 've had this thing for less than a month  treated it quite well  never dropped it  and the headphone jack is all screwed up" 
E,size[-][u]weight[-][u]wheel[-],"kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward  but i can deal with that" 
E,software[-],"software definitely sucks  hangs up my notebook about half the time  but i do n't mind buying notmad" 
E,player[-],"i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive" 
E,player[-],"i loved it until it broke  but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work" 
E,product[+] sound[+] use[+],"i loved this product when i first got it - great sound  easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood" 
E,durability[-],"i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero" 
E,hard drive[-],"always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped" 
E,player[-][u],"i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler" 
E,[t] the best jukebox mp3 player  hands-down" 
E,player[+],"the combination of the price  storage size  and player features makes this player the best on the market" 
E,software[+],"fact is  it could n't be easier to use" 
E,sound quality[+],"sound quality on this is amazing  as with all creative products" 
E,sound[+][u],"even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback" 
E,menu[+],"the menu allows you to search for files by artist  genre  and album quite easily" 
E,battery[+],"the battery stays charged for a long time  and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter" 
E,player[+],"connect the player to your computer ( via usb )  open up mediasource  and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! 
E,usb 2.0[+],"usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast" 
E,folder[-],"minor complaints , 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player  the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable" 
E,folder[-],"the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player  but not the folder name" 
E,id3 tag[-],"2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown" " 
E,nomad explorer[-],"3 ) with mediasource being so easy  i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software" 
E,nomad explorer[-],"in fact  it caused my system to hang more times than not  so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 %" 
E,player[+][u],"my first impression was positive" 
E,eax[-],"first  the sound quality is okay  but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes" 
E,menue[-]control[-],"second  the menu system and controls are poorly designed" 
E,scroll[-],"the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well" 
E,button[-],"the general button placement is not very user friendly" 
E,case[-],"third  the poor design continues with the case" 
E,[t] creative nomad zen xtra 40 gb" 
E,price[+],"overall  a good buy for the price" 
E,navigation[+],"easy enough to navigate through  although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton" 
E,battery life[-],"my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of" 
E,battery[-],"there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! 
E,lock up[-],"i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times" 
E,construction[-],"the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case" 
E,case[-],"at the very least  a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice" 
E,storage[+]navigation[+]playlist[+]battery[+],"pros , huge storage capacity for the price  easy to navigate  can modify existing playlists on the fly  has a removable battery 
E,battery life[-]manual[-]lock up[-]replacement battery[-],"battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised  no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line )  occasional software lockups  replacement battery is expensive 
E,[t] hard disk mp3 players" 
E,construction[-]support[-]scroll wheel[-]headphone jack[-],"creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality  poor product support  difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack" 
E,build[-],"what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off" 
E,support[-],"feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen  it applies to all the company 's products" 
E,scroll wheel[-],"the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device" 
E,software[-],"the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers" 
E,headphone jack[-],"enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem" 
E,folder[-],"the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders  documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen  so it is not a hard disk  it 's a storage device at best" 
E,sound quality[+],"reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive" 
E,price[+][u],"sure  this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod" 
E,quality[-],"but with a low price  comes lower quality" 
E,sound quality[+]battery life[+]price[+],"our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality  great features  long battery life  and an unbeatable price" 
E,player[-][p],"the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap" 
E,headphone jack[-],"i did n't abuse it  i charged it every day  but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out" 
E,player[+],"i bought the player this week and i like it by far" 
E,battery[+],"removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1- years" 
E,value[+],"value , comparing data storage with price" 
E,appearance[+],"the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly )" 
E,size[+],"the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod" ) 
E,use[+],"easy to use , a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 
E,mediasource[-],"the software  mediasource  cannot work on my pc" ( laptop  intel p4-.0  xp os )" 
E,software[-],"in fact  each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place" 
E,size[+]value[+]design[+]software[-],"in short  this player is good at size  value  hardware design but really bad at its software 
E,display[+],"the display is awesome  you can see everything you want and read it clearly 
E,storage[+],"huge storage space  i loaded my entire collection of music  which isnt that much  400 songs  and still have 26 gb  out of the 28 provided to you" 
E,sound[+],"the sound is awesome  but if u put it too loud  depends on yoursound quality  the sound might crack" 
E,eax[+],"with eax on  you can modify your sound  with 4 different presets  which is pretty good  you can get different variations with it" 
E,software[+],"if you use software correctly  put in all the id3 tags  you will get an awesome database collection  from which you can easily access your songs" 
E,software[+],"i dont know what other people are saying  but the software is awesome" 
E,battery[+],"battery recharge  is an awesome thing  because it recharges in only like 2- hours" 
E,player[+],"when you turn on your player  the player turns on really fast  and the music continues to play  as you left it when you were turning it off" 
E,manage[+],"you can manage your profile  change the contrast of backlight  make different type of display  either list or tabbed" 
E,interface[+],"you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface  you can see the interface as modern or classical" 
E,alarm[+],"there is an alarm  i still havent used it yet  but it should be good" 
E,clock[+],"there is a clock  and date  which can get helpful" 
E,firmware[+],"the player has firmware  which will remove the glitches  if there are any" 
E,music[+],"the music plays awesome  never skips  even if u run for a bit  so you can listen to music without interruption" 
E,battery life[-],"the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with  in this player  is the battery life" 
E,panel[-],"the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said" 
E,transfer[-],"you need the software to actually transfer files 
E,player[-],"the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on  60 percent of the time  it sais  shutting down  which means i have to turn off  and turn it on again  which is not to my likings" 
E,lock up[-][u],"also  the player sometimes freezes  not a very big problem  but can also be annoying" 
E,price[+],"and also  it 's priced very affordably" 
E,storage[+],"with 40gb of storage i have about 7500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2500 more" 
E,software[+],"the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted" 
E,sound[+]earbud[-],"the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones" 
E,sound setting[+],"sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference" 
E,accessing file[+],"accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive" 
E,battery[+],"possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery" 
E,battery[+],"since batteries do run out on everything  this will also be a big money-saver since ipods  irivers  rca  dell  all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement )" 
E,value[+]use[+],"try before you buy if at all possible , although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod  the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface" 
E,color[+],"i like the nomad 's color better  but it 's not terribly flashy" 
E,player[+][p],"i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it" 
E,price[+],"price ! 
E,sound quality[+]volume[+],"sound quality is wonderful  i really like the smart volume sound normalization" 
E,earphone[-],"yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway" 
E,interface[+],"i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough" 
E,playlist[+],"i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! 
E,software[-],"creative software stinks" 
E,cover[-],"the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day" 
E,player[+],"have had the player since xmass and love it ! 
E,sound[+]battery life[+]battery[+]storage[+]screen[+] firmware[+]price[+],"great sound  very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours )  very fast recharges rate  removable battery  storage size  nice screen  firmware updates  and great price" 
E,warranty[-]freeze up[-]navigation wheel[-],"short warranty ( 3 months  so i got the extended warranty at best buy )  occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery )  somewhat flimsy navigation wheel" 
E,player[+],"this is an excellent player  especially for the price  with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod" 
E,price[+],"for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster  and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some" 
E,size[+]design[+],"the system is terrific in size and design  imo looking better than the ipods" 
E,build[+],"it 's very solidly built  and has a nice dense feel to it" 
E,control[+],"i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least" 
E,scroll wheel[+],"the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well  in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there" 
E,screen[+],"the screen 's large and easily read" 
E,pop-up face[-],"the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face  that sometimes comes off a bit easily  but besides that it 's perfect" 
E,sound[+],"sound , exceptional  though i can 't really compare it to the ipod" 
E,interface[+],"interface - practically seamless" 
E,id3 tag[+],"yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy" 
E,playlist[+],"playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software  and there are a bevy of eq options" 
E,balance[-],"the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance" 
E,mediasource[+],"as i mentioned before  the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said  though notmad may still work better" 
E,mediasource[+][p],"it 's easy to transfer  preview  and organize files" 
E,id3 tag[+],"the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point  as well" 
E,software[+],"it was no problem for me to use their software" 
E,player[+],"overall  i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over  but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack  hissing  or scroll wheel problems show up with me too" 
E,equipment[+],"please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod" 
E,player[-],"do n't buy this player" 
E,player[-],"unfortunately  after loading 280 + songs  all i get now is " player either not connected or busy" " 
E,player[-],"do n't buy this player" 
E,product[-],"do not buy this product -- 
E,player[-],"i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended" 
E,software[-],"the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products  which is very dumb" 
E,player[+],"honestly  i love this player" 
E,sound[+]battery life[-],"once again  the sound is awesome  the batterly life is only 6- hours  and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life" 
E,hard drive[-],"however  my hard drive did fail  and i have not dropped it once" 
E,break[+],"because other people that complain about this player are talking bull  this player is awesome  it just breaks fast  which is horrible" 
E,player[-][u],"what a junk" 
E,freeze[-],"every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes" 
E,sound quality[+],"the sound quality is very good" 
E,control[-]software[-],"the controls are somewhat harder to use  and there are some oddities about the software tagging system  but most people can live with this" 
E,storage[+][u],"having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific" 
E,headphone jack[-],"typically  the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others" 
E,design[-][p],"i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed  and will not hold up to normal use" 
E,headphone jack[-],"the headphone jack seems to be a major problem" 
E,front cover[-],"the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover  which is taken off to have access to the battery  seemed to come undone very easily" 
E,headphone jack[-],"the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire" 
E,lock up[-],"the other day when i was listening to a song  it locked up and will not do anything now" 
E,hard drive[-],"in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class"

C,manual[+],"the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain" 
C,auto focus[+]scene mode[+],"the auto-focus performs well  but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof  and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera" 
C,rechargable battery[+],"comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit  included  is fast and small" 
C,camera[+],"i enthusiastically recommend this camera" 
C,camera[+][p] use[+][u] feature[+],"it 's easy to use  and yet very feature rich"

C,macro mode[+]picture[+],"the macro mode is exceptional  the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject" 
C,battery life[+],"the battery life is very good  i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time  the first time around  and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then  and have yet needed to recharge it" 
C,camera[+] use[+],"i fell in love with this camera  it combines ease of use  with an immense amount of options and power" 
C,camera[+],"this camera is ideal for people who want more power  but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera"
