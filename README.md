im use the Bing Liu corpus data about the opinion mining amazon in electronical reviews.

Step 1. Apply the command in history.prc to corpus for cleaning the data and making a file with all data. In the file corpus2/ exists a extod.txt(with a part of all the corpus) and tod.txt(with all the corpus cleaning and filtered)

POS tag JJR //adjective, comparative

POS tag JJS //adjective, superlative
POS tag RBS //adjective, superlative

At the final of the python experiments are a accuracy calculus for all the data, but for scientific rigor in the next commints making a functions for testing, how can accurated are the experiments and the implementations of machine learning into this discussion.
